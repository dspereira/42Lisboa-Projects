## About Me
I'm an electrical engineer with a passion for software development and technology. Currently, I'm a student at 42 Lisboa, where I'm deepening my knowledge in computer engineering.
I'm especially interested in building a career in web development, focusing on JavaScript. To this end, I'm dedicated to enhancing my skills and expertise in this field.

My technical skills include proficiency in C/C++, JavaScript, and SQL, which Iâ€™ve developed through my projects at 42 Lisboa and previous experience. Additionally, I have working knowledge of other tools and technologies, such as Python, Java, and Docker, although at a less advanced level.
